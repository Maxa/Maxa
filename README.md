Hi, I'm Mikko

I'm interested in data, open source and you guessed it, open data. BSc in Environment Technology, in 2024 I graduated as a Master of Science in Management and Information Technology

I do some basic scripting, that you might find here. Below is listed the tools and programming languages that I often find myself using:
- SQL in work context
- Microsoft Power BI (Power Query M, DAX) and Tableau
- PowerShell (5.1 and current) for scripting on Windows
- Linux-based OSes (currently Fedora and Debian) outside work environment
- Raspberry Pis, I have 3 of which not all are in use
- Z shell

I would like to learn more about:
- Python. I have done basic programming including machine learning at school, but there is still so much to learn, especially in the data domain
